I heard about [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and was curious about it. Their [Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) guide is about creating a blog website. So I was reading it and I liked how simple it was to create a website like this.

Next.js is frontend framework for React based web applications. As I already learned a little of React, it was easy to follow the tutorial.

So I decided to use their example, tweaking some little things, and use it as my website. One of the advantages is that Next.js generates static content that can load faster and it also can be better for SEO.

Another thing is that their example used markdown files for posts and the few posts I had were already in markdown format.

It was also easy to deploy it in the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) platform. I just linked my Github account with the Vercel account and it automatically deploys the website when I push the code to Github. Vercel is also the creator of Next.js.
